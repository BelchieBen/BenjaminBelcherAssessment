# SOFT27001
## Welcome
This is my project for the SOFT27001 Software Design & Implementation module, in this repository are:
- All the source files to build and run the application
- The development report
- Doxygen generated documentation for the code
- The video demo file and online link

## Building the project
If you want to build and run the application on your system you need to do the following:
- Clone this repository to your computer
- Open it in QT Creator
- Update the database path, this can be found in `services/dataservice.cpp` and you should change the `path` variable on line 12 to your local path to the `database/` directory
- Click the run button end enjoy!


## Doxygen
To view the project documentation go into the `html` folder and open any of the `.html` files. This will open the docs and from there you can navigate through the classes.
